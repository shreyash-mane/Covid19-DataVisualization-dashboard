- COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard
An Interactive dashboard to Explore the Global Impact of COVID-19

 About the Project:- 
This project is an interactive COVID-19 dashboard designed to visualize the impact of the pandemic across different countries. 
Using D3.js, it provides dynamic data representations through a rotating 3D globe, bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

Data Source: 
COVID-19 global datasets tracking cases, deaths, and government response policies.

Features of our project :

Rotating Globe – View global COVID-19 data with color-coded intensity, where darker shades indicate more cases. Click on any country to see its specific data.
Bar Chart – Compare total cases and deaths per million for selected countries. Understand which nations were hit hardest and how their cases compare globally.
Line Chart – Analyze the relationship between government restrictions and COVID-19 cases over time. Did stricter policies help reduce infections? Find out through this visualization.
Scatter Plot – Explore the impact of lockdown policies on fatality rates. This graph helps reveal whether stricter rules actually saved more lives.
