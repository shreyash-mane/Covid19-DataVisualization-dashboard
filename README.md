
This is the repository for the the Data Visualisation & Analytics course group project.

You should work from this template.
- One member of your group (e.g. group leader) should create a fork of the project under their namespace.
- When forking the project, replace f2xdv, campus and group, with your cohort (f20dv or f21dv), campus (DU, ED or MY) and group number respectively.
- That one member can then invite other members in the group to their forked project, as maintainers.
- The lecturers/TA will be automatically added to the project.
