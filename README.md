This repository is for the the Data Visualisation & Analytics course group project.
    One member of your group (e.g. group leader) should create a fork of the project under their namespace.
        When forking the project, replace f2xdv, campus and group, with your cohort, campus and group number respectively.
    That one member can then invite other members in the group to their forked project, as maintainers.
    The lecturers/TA will be automatically added to the project.
