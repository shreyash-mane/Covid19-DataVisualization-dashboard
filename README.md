An Interactive dashboard to Explore the Global Impact of COVID-19

 About the Project:- 
This project is an interactive COVID-19 dashboard designed to visualize the impact of the pandemic across different countries. 
Using D3.js, it provides dynamic data representations through a rotating 3D globe, bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

Data Source: 
COVID-19 global datasets tracking cases, deaths, and government response policies.

 Project structure :
 /f-21-dv-gp-edinburgh-13
── index.html          # Main landing page with interactive globe
── styles.css          # Styles for the dashboard
── constants.js        # Stores global configurations
─- infobox.js          # Controls the information boxes
── globe.js            # Handles the rotating globe visualization
── groupedbarChart.js  # Renders the grouped bar chart
── lineChart.js        # Generates the line chart
── scatterChart.js     # Creates the scatter plot

Features of our project :

Rotating Globe – View global COVID-19 data with color-coded intensity, where darker shades indicate more cases. Click on any country to see its specific data.
Bar Chart – Compare total cases and deaths per million for selected countries. Understand which nations were hit hardest and how their cases compare globally.
Line Chart – Analyze the relationship between government restrictions and COVID-19 cases over time. Did stricter policies help reduce infections? Find out through this visualization.
Scatter Plot – Explore the impact of lockdown policies on fatality rates. This graph helps reveal whether stricter rules actually saved more lives.

If we want to know the total cases for each country it is showing when we are hovering on their map. after clicking on spoecific country it will zoom in to that country 
Further there is view more button it will render you to the line chart page where you will see the stringency vs toatal cases graph.
If you want to go back to landing page there is back to globe button where you can click and go back to landing page . to know more about our story you have to click on further insight button which is
